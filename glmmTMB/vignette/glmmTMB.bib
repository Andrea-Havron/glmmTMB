	abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models {(GLMMs)} provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on {GLMMs} in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating {GLMM} parameters in simple cases, complex {GLMMs} are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of {GLMMs} in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize [`]best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

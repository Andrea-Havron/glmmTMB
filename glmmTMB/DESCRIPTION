Description: Fit linear and generalized linear mixed models with or without
    zero-inflation. The models are fit using maximum likelihood estimation
    via TMB (Template Model Builder). Random effects are assumed to be
    Gaussian and are integrated out to produce the marginal likelihood using
    the Laplace approximation. Gradients are calulated using automtic
    differentiation.
